//Big O notation is a way of describing time complexity of an algorithm.
//Instead of just having sum return an integer value for the result, we have it 
//return an object with a .result property which will contain the sum, 
//and a .ticks property that we can use to measure the number of operations done by our algorithm. 

//relation between number of operations and input size is directly proportional.
//this is an example of linear time complexity (O(n))

//Take your solutions from the iterative exercises today 
//and identify the time complexities (big O) of each of them.

//One-Counting Sheep
//The solution has O(n) (linear) complexity because it has one for loop, and the amount of times around the loop


// Power Calculator
//This solution has 0(1) (Constant) complexity because the work being done isn't dependent on "n"

//Reverse a String
//This solution has 0(1) (Constant) complexity because the work being done isn't dependent on "n"


//Triangular Number
//This solution has 0(n^2) exponential complexity because increasing the value of "n" causes work to be done to grow exponentially

//String Splitter
//the solution is 0(1) or constnat because the work to be done doesnt depend on the value of "n"

//Fibonnaci
//This solution is linear because the amount of work to be done is directly proportional to the value of "n"

//Factorial
//solution has 0(n) or linear complexity
